intro to algo 590: union by rank approach make the root of the tree with fewer nodes point to the root of the tree with more nodes. rather than explicitly keeping track of the size of the subtree rooted at each node, for each node, we maintain a rank, which is an upper bound on the height of the node. In union by rank, we make the root with smaller rank point to the root with larger rank during a union operation
